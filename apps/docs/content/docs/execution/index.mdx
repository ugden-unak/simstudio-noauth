Sim Studio's execution engine brings your workflows to life by processing blocks in the correct order, managing data flow, and handling errors gracefully.

<Callout type="info">
  Every workflow execution follows a deterministic path based on your block connections and logic, ensuring predictable and reliable results.

## Key Concepts

### Topological Execution
Blocks execute in dependency order, similar to how a spreadsheet recalculates cells. The execution engine automatically determines which blocks can run based on completed dependencies.

### Path Tracking
The engine actively tracks execution paths through your workflow. Router and Condition blocks dynamically update these paths, ensuring only relevant blocks execute.

### Layer-Based Processing
Instead of executing blocks one-by-one, the engine identifies layers of blocks that can run in parallel, optimizing performance for complex workflows.

### Execution Context
Each workflow maintains a rich context during execution containing:
- Block outputs and states
- Active execution paths
- Loop and parallel iteration tracking
- Environment variables
- Routing decisions

## Execution Triggers

Workflows can be executed through multiple channels:

- **Manual**: Test and debug directly in the editor
- **Deploy as API**: Create an HTTP endpoint secured with API keys
- **Deploy as Chat**: Create a conversational interface on a custom subdomain
- **Webhooks**: Respond to external events from third-party services
- **Scheduled**: Run on a recurring schedule using cron expressions

### Deploy as API

When you deploy a workflow as an API, Sim Studio:
- Creates a unique HTTP endpoint: `https://simstudio.ai/api/workflows/{workflowId}/execute`
- Generates an API key for authentication
- Accepts POST requests with JSON payloads
- Returns workflow execution results as JSON

Example API call:
```bash
curl -X POST https://simstudio.ai/api/workflows/your-workflow-id/execute \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "your data here"}'
```

### Deploy as Chat

Chat deployment creates a conversational interface for your workflow:
- Hosted on a custom subdomain: `https://your-name.simstudio.ai`
- Optional authentication (public, password, or email-based)
- Customizable UI with your branding
- Streaming responses for real-time interaction
- Perfect for AI assistants, support bots, or interactive tools

Each deployment method passes data to your workflow's starter block, beginning the execution flow.

## Programmatic Execution

Execute workflows from your applications using our official SDKs:

```bash
# TypeScript/JavaScript
npm install simstudio-ts-sdk

# Python
pip install simstudio-sdk
```

```typescript
// TypeScript Example
import { SimStudioClient } from 'simstudio-ts-sdk';

const client = new SimStudioClient({ 
  apiKey: 'your-api-key' 
});

const result = await client.executeWorkflow('workflow-id', {
  input: { message: 'Hello' }
});
```

## Best Practices

### Design for Reliability
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate fallback paths
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Add logging to Function blocks for debugging

### Optimize Performance
- Minimize external API calls where possible
- Use parallel execution for independent operations
- Cache results with Memory blocks when appropriate

### Monitor Executions
- Review logs regularly to understand performance patterns
- Track costs for AI model usage
- Use workflow snapshots to debug issues
