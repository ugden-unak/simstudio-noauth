Connections are the pathways that allow data to flow between blocks in your workflow. They define how information is passed from one block to another, enabling you to create sophisticated, multi-step processes.

<Callout type="info">
  Properly configured connections are essential for creating effective workflows. They determine how
  data moves through your system and how blocks interact with each other.
