## How Connections Work

Connections are the pathways that allow data to flow between blocks in your workflow. When you connect two blocks in Sim Studio, you're establishing a data flow relationship that defines how information passes from one block to another.

<Callout type="info">
  Each connection represents a directed relationship where data flows from a source block's output
  to a destination block's input.
</Callout>

### Creating Connections

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <strong>Select Source Block</strong>: Click on the output port of the block you want to connect
    from
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Draw Connection</strong>: Drag to the input port of the destination block
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Confirm Connection</strong>: Release to create the connection
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Configure (Optional)</strong>: Some connections may require additional configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Connection Flow

The flow of data through connections follows these principles:

1. **Directional Flow**: Data always flows from outputs to inputs
2. **Execution Order**: Blocks execute in order based on their connections
3. **Data Transformation**: Data may be transformed as it passes between blocks
4. **Conditional Paths**: Some blocks (like Router and Condition) can direct flow to different paths

### Connection Visualization

Connections are visually represented in the workflow editor:

- **Solid Lines**: Active connections that will pass data
- **Animated Flow**: During execution, data flow is visualized along connections
- **Color Coding**: Different connection types may have different colors
- **Connection Tags**: Visual indicators showing what data is available

### Managing Connections

You can manage your connections in several ways:

- **Delete**: Click on a connection and press Delete or use the context menu
- **Reroute**: Drag a connection to change its path
- **Inspect**: Click on a connection to see details about the data being passed
- **Disable**: Temporarily disable a connection without deleting it

<Callout type="warning">
  Deleting a connection will immediately stop data flow between the blocks. Make sure this is
  intended before removing connections.
</Callout>

## Connection Compatibility

Not all blocks can be connected to each other. Compatibility depends on:

1. **Data Type Compatibility**: The output type must be compatible with the input type
2. **Block Restrictions**: Some blocks may have restrictions on what they can connect to
3. **Workflow Logic**: Connections must make logical sense in the context of your workflow

The editor will indicate when connections are invalid or incompatible.
