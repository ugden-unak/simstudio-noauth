Variables in Sim Studio act as a global store for data that can be accessed and modified by any block in your workflow. They provide a powerful way to share information between different parts of your workflow, maintain state, and create more dynamic applications.

  Variables allow you to store and share data across your entire workflow, making it easy to
  maintain state and create complex, interconnected systems.
</Callout>

## Overview

The Variables feature serves as a central data store for your workflow, enabling you to:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <strong>Store global data</strong>: Create variables that persist throughout workflow execution
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Share information between blocks</strong>: Access the same data from any block in your
    workflow
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Maintain workflow state</strong>: Keep track of important values as your workflow runs
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <strong>Create dynamic workflows</strong>: Build more flexible systems that can adapt based on
    stored values
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating Variables

You can create and manage variables from the Variables panel in the sidebar. Each variable has:

- **Name**: A unique identifier used to reference the variable
- **Value**: The data stored in the variable (supports various data types)
- **Description** (optional): A note explaining the variable's purpose

## Accessing Variables

Variables can be accessed from any block in your workflow using the variable dropdown. Simply:

1. Type `<` in any text field within a block
2. Browse the dropdown menu to select from available variables
3. Select the variable you want to use

</div>

  You can also drag the connection tag into a field to open the variable dropdown and access
  available variables.
</Callout>

## Variable Types

Variables in Sim Studio can store various types of data:

<Tabs items={['Text', 'Numbers', 'Boolean', 'Objects', 'Arrays']}>
  <Tab>
    ```
    "Hello, World!"
    ```
    <p className="mt-2">Text variables store strings of characters. They're useful for storing messages, names, and other text data.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    42
    ```
    <p className="mt-2">Number variables store numeric values that can be used in calculations or comparisons.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```
    true
    ```
    <p className="mt-2">Boolean variables store true/false values, perfect for flags and condition checks.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```json
    {
      "name": "John",
      "age": 30,
      "city": "New York"
    }
    ```
    <p className="mt-2">Object variables store structured data with properties and values.</p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```json
    [1, 2, 3, "four", "five"]
    ```
    <p className="mt-2">Array variables store ordered collections of items.</p>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Variables in Blocks

When you access a variable from a block, you can:

- **Read its value**: Use the variable's current value in your block's logic
- **Modify it**: Update the variable's value based on your block's processing
- **Use it in expressions**: Include variables in expressions and calculations

## Variable Scope

Variables in Sim Studio have global scope, meaning:

- They are accessible from any block in your workflow
- Any block can modify them
- Changes to variables persist throughout workflow execution
- Variables maintain their values between runs, unless explicitly reset

## Best Practices

- **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose variable names that clearly indicate what the variable represents. For example, use `userPreferences` instead of `up`.
- **Document Your Variables**: Add descriptions to your variables to help other team members understand their purpose and usage.
- **Consider Variable Scope**: Remember that variables are global and can be modified by any block. Design your workflow with this in mind to prevent unexpected behavior.
- **Initialize Variables Early**: Set up and initialize your variables at the beginning of your workflow to ensure they're available when needed.
- **Handle Missing Variables**: Always consider the case where a variable might not yet exist or might have an unexpected value. Add appropriate validation in your blocks.
- **Limit Variable Count**: Keep the number of variables manageable. Too many variables can make your workflow difficult to understand and maintain.
