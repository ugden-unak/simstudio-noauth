Sim Studio is a visual workflow editor that enables you to build AI-powered applications by connecting blocks on a canvas. Drag and drop components to create chatbots, automation workflows, and data processing pipelines without writing code.

## What Makes Sim Studio Powerful

**Multi-Model AI Support** - Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Groq, Cerebras, and local models through Ollama. Switch providers without rebuilding workflows.

**60+ Pre-Built Tools** - Gmail, Slack, Notion, Google Sheets, Airtable, Supabase, Pinecone, and more. Extensible architecture allows custom tool integration.

**Flexible Execution** - Run workflows via chat interface, REST API, webhooks, scheduled jobs, or trigger from external systems.

**Production Deployment** - Deploy as APIs, integrate with existing systems using our SDK, or embed as plugins. Built-in monitoring, logging, and error handling.

**Real-time Collaboration** - Work simultaneously with team members on the same workflow, like Google Docs for AI development.

Connect multiple AI models, integrate with 60+ services, and deploy production-ready applications through an intuitive visual interface designed specifically for AI development.
